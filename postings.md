# Jobs Postings I Like

[Q CELLS DevOps Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2818882264)
I like that this is a renewable energy company.
I'm a very good fit for most of their DevOps related requirements. I don't have the knowledge/experience that they're looking for in Kubernetes, Kafka, and ElasticSearch. Yet!
