## Summary
I want to use skills to achieve something meaningful. I'm interested in renewable energy, environmental restoration, sustainable economic development, effective mass transit, cycling infrastructure and safety, continuing education, and media awareness. I want to solve big problems by designing systems with direct impact.


## Experience

2009 - Present
eCivis : Principal Engineer/Architect

I created several generations of infrastructure and brought devops methodologies and practices to the company. I wrote successful applications, ReSTful APIs, and microservices, primarily in CFML, serving thousands of customers. I supported a software development team of ten engineers by providing guidance and mentoring. I designed system access and developed procedures to support contractors and employees from other departments. I accepted responsibility for dozens of project repositories by reviewing pull requests and encouraging improvements and maintaining quality.


1994 - Present
Lamoree Software : Owner

I have maintained a business license for many years and performed a handful of consulting engagements. I've always had an entrepreneurial interest, but the fact is that I want to write code and solve problems more than I want to manage finances, perform marketing, and negotiate contracts. So, my personal business remains a someday maybe project.


2001 - 2009
Teleologic Learning Company : Systems ArchitectSystems Architect

I developed and operated a learning management system for custom courseware. I pushed the boundaries of what was possible at the time for online content creation and helped institutions deliver engaging material to hybrid onsite/online cohorts. I grew professionally and became a strong, contributing proponent of open source software. I honed skills in customer communication and effective design.


1998 - 2001
Nextron Interactive : Director Technology

I lead a small team of web developers to create custom applications for a variety of clients. It was early days for my industry, but some of the products I created went on to mature very well. I wrote commerce applications, a magazine's first web presence, intranets for linked information (what you'd call a wiki today), and B2B services.


1994 - 1998
Diamond Multimedia : Technical Support

While at Diamond, I performed several roles from providing technical assistance to customers via phone and email, to implementing a knowledge base and creating internal websites. I created the company's FTP server with automations for distributing driver updates. I maintained engineering workstations and assisting with build and release functions.
